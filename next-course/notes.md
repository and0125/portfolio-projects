# Notes

taking the full udemy course on nextjs with Mongoose.

We'll use the server rendering components and server actions, rather than doing an API in this course.

Not going to explain useState, and useEffects.

Nextjs is technically a metaframework, not a framework in itself.

_PropertyPulse_: is the project for this site.
