# Initial Architecture Guidance

## Architecture Overview

1. **Email Collection System**

   - Gmail API integration to access your inbox
   - Parser to identify and extract newsletter content
   - Storage component for email source addresses

2. **Content Processing Pipeline**

   - Text extraction from various email formats (HTML, plain text)
   - Natural language processing for content summarization
   - Database for storing full content and summaries

3. **Scheduling System**

   - Cron job or serverless function trigger for daily execution
   - Selection algorithm for identifying top points
   - Formatting component for LinkedIn-specific content

4. **LinkedIn Integration**
   - LinkedIn API authentication
   - Content posting mechanism
   - Status tracking for successful posts

## Implementation Approach

For a practical implementation, I recommend:

1. **Data Collection**

   - Use Gmail API with OAuth to securely access your inbox
   - Create filters to identify newsletters based on sender patterns
   - Build a sender repository in a simple database like SQLite

2. **Content Storage**

   - Use a document database like MongoDB for storing email content
   - Index content for searchability and topic extraction
   - Store metadata like sender, date, subject separately

3. **Content Processing**

   - Implement NLP using a library like spaCy or a service like OpenAI API
   - Extract key points using text summarization techniques
   - Rank points by relevance, novelty, or other custom metrics

4. **Automation**

   - Set up a scheduled AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Function
   - Configure daily triggers at your preferred posting time
   - Include error handling and notification system

5. **LinkedIn Integration**
   - Use LinkedIn API with proper authentication
   - Format content for LinkedIn's specifications
   - Include tracking for post performance metrics

This system could be built as a lightweight application using Python, with minimal infrastructure costs if you leverage serverless computing options.

Is there any particular component you'd like me to elaborate on further?
