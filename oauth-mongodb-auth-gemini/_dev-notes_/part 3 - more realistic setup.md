# Notes

## More Realistic setup

We skipped some of the detailed processes earlier for simplicity, but we can go over how to implement a more production ready scenario now.

For revising the `authorize\route.js` route, we need to add the following steps:

- check user authentication: check if the user is already logged into the application. This usually takes the form of checking for the presence of an authentication cookie or session. If the user is not authenticated, then we need to redirect them to the login page (our `/login` route). Before redirecting to the login route, we also need to make sure to store the details of the current authorization request (client id, redirect uri, scope, state) so that after a successful login, we can resume the authorization flow.This could be done using a temporary session or by passing these parameters through the login form.
- display the consent screen: once the user is authenticated, we need to present them with a consent screen, which should clearly display, the name of the client application, the permissions a client is requesting, and a clear statement of whether or not to authorize or deny these requests.
- Handle User consent:
  - if a user denies the consent, then they should be redicted back to the redirect uri with an error parameter and the original state parameter.
  - if a user grants consent, then the should proceed to generating an authorization code. Instead of just logging it, we must securely store the authorization code in the database.The record should include, the authorization code itself, the user_id, the client_id, the redirect_uri, the scope, and the state parameter, and a timestamp for when the code was created and its expiration time. Then it should redirect the user back to the clients application with the authorization code and the state parameters.

For implementation you'd need to consider:

- session management: a mechanism for managing user sessions, libraries like iron-session or creating your own session with the `cookies` package can help with this.
- consent storage: you'll need a mongoDB collection to store the generated codes and their associated information.
- UI for Login and Consent: you'd need to create pages `login` and `consent` for handling the user interactions to authenticate and then to grant consent.

Here's a conceptual version of the authorize right for including these steps:

```javascript
// app/api/auth/authorize/route.js (Conceptual - with authentication and consent flow)
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { findUserById } from '@/lib/models/user';
import { generateRandomString } from '@/lib/utils';
// Import your database utility for storing authorization codes
// import { storeAuthorizationCode } from '@/lib/db';

const authorizedClients = { /* ... */ };

export async function GET(request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const clientId = searchParams.get('client_id');
  const responseType = searchParams.get('response_type');
  const redirectUri = searchParams.get('redirect_uri');
  const scope = searchParams.get('scope');
  const state = searchParams.get('state');

  // ... (Validation of request parameters as before) ...

  // 1. Check if user is authenticated (using session/cookies)
  const isAuthenticated = /* ... your authentication check ... */;
  const currentUserId = /* ... get user ID from session ... */;

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    // Store authorization request details temporarily
    // Redirect to /login with these details
    // return NextResponse.redirect(`/login?client_id=${clientId}&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&scope=${scope}&state=${state}`, { status: 302 });
    console.warn('User not authenticated - redirect to login (implementation needed)');
    return new NextResponse('User not authenticated', { status: 401 }); // Temporary
  }

  // 2. User is authenticated, now show consent screen
  // In a real app, you would fetch client details and requested scopes
  // and render a UI asking the user to authorize.

  // For this conceptual step, we'll simulate consent:
  const userGrantedConsent = true; // In reality, this comes from user interaction

  if (userGrantedConsent) {
    const authorizationCode = generateRandomString(32);

    // 3. Store the authorization code in the database
    const authorizationCodeDetails = {
      code: authorizationCode,
      userId: currentUserId,
      clientId: clientId,
      redirectUri: redirectUri,
      scope: scope,
      state: state,
      expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000), // Example: expires in 5 minutes
    };
    // await storeAuthorizationCode(authorizationCodeDetails); // Implement this function

    console.log('Generated and (would be) stored Authorization Code:', authorizationCode);

    // 4. Redirect back to the client
    const redirectUrl = new URL(redirectUri);
    redirectUrl.searchParams.set('code', authorizationCode);
    redirectUrl.searchParams.set('state', state);
    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl.toString(), { status: 302 });
  } else {
    // User denied consent
    const redirectUrl = new URL(redirectUri);
    redirectUrl.searchParams.set('error', 'access_denied');
    redirectUrl.searchParams.set('state', state);
    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl.toString(), { status: 302 });
  }
}
```
